#This file should manage the routing of messages between nodes
# The logic for
#   Uplink -> hop_count
#   Downlink -> the message goes in the same opposite direction
# should be implemented here
# Take in consideration that when a node receives a message not meant for him 
# it should just forward no need to decipher the DTLS layer
